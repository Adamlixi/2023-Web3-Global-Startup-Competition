# PromptNetwork

PromptNetwork is a decentralized Key Management Service (KMS) network that turns a typical NFT into a semi-private NFT, allowing anyone to safely share private information with token holders. This applies to various types of digital content, including comics, prompts, music, and videos in NFT format.

The first use case and the interface to PromptNetwork is PromptSea (https://promptsea.io) which has been live on Mainnet since November 2022. It is an NFT marketplace for trading AI-prompts and generative works.
