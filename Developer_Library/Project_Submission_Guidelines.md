# Project Submission Guidelines



Thanks for joining the 2023 Web3 Global Startup Competition!

The competition features four divisions, and you are required to submit your project before the deadline for the corresponding division.

These guidelines will teach you how to submit your project to the GitHub repository  (**[2023-Web3-Global-Startup-Competition](https://github.com/PlatONnetwork/2023-Web3-Global-Startup-Competition)**) corresponding to the relevant division.



## Submission Process



1. Enter the official  [GitHub](https://github.com/PlatONnetwork/2023-Web3-Global-Startup-Competition) - `PlatONnetwork/2023-Web3-Global-Startup-Competition` repository of the competition.

   

2. Select "**Fork**" to copy the official repository to your personal GitHub repository;

   Note: "Fork" means creating a personal copy of the repository. You can make any changes on the personal copy and submit those changes to the original repository, and the admin will review and merge your changes.
