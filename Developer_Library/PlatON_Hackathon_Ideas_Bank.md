# PlatON Hackathon Ideas Bank

This Hackathon aims to encourage developers to actively participate in the development practices on the PlatON.  We encourage participants to create innovative blockchain projects, including infrastructure, applications, peripherals, etc. **The following are some ideas and suggestions from the PlatON community.**

## Infrastructure or underlying protocol layer

The layer provides a reliable and secure foundation for the upper application layer, and mainly includes the protocol code and basic hardware facilities on the lowest layer of the blockchain.

- **The underlying protocol**

  The underlying protocol is the lowest and most basic part of blockchain applications. It maintains network node and enables API calls. It is built mainly through technologies such as network programming, encryption algorithms, and data storage.

- **Anonymity technology**

  Anonymity technology is used to solve user privacy issues.

- **Security optimization**

  Consensus security, transaction security, etc.

- **Peripherals (explorers, wallets, and tools)**

  Peripherals provide users (users/developers in the ecosystem) with various convenient, usable and easy-to-use services.

## General application layer

This layer mainly provides high-level APIs for blockchain application developers to build practical blockchain applications.

- **Smart contract**

  That is, a "programmable contract". A smart contract allows credible transactions without a third party. These transactions are traceable and irreversible. Generally speaking, when the set conditions are met, the contract is automatically executed. It represents a major direction for the future development of blockchain.

- **Cross-chain**

  Among the many problems facing blockchain, network isolation hinders the collaborative operation of different blockchains, which greatly limits the development space for blockchain. Cross-chain technology is the key to realizing the value of the Internet. In simple terms, by cross-chain, a communication protocol can be executed from one chain to another. The two chains can be a parent chain and a child chain, or they can be side chains.

- **Layer 2 network**

  Layer 2 pursues the ultimate performance. Layer 2 network can reduce the burden on Layer 1 by sharing most of its computation workload, thereby improving service processing efficiency and achieving scaling. Layer 2 can only achieve partial consensus, but it can meet the needs of various scenarios.

- **Privacy-preserving computation**

  Current models mostly rely on the training of massive data, and the demand for massive data has led to the raging data privacy issues. Privacy-preserving computation can aggregate computation and train models using data scattered across multiple parties without aggregating massive data, while making the data of each party unexposed throughout the process, e.g. the migration of Ethereum-related privacy-preserving projects.

- **Information** security

  It is used to secure the development and the information on the blockchain, and to provide blockchain application developers with a safer development environment and security audits.

- **DAO**

  DAO, a form of organizational structure based on the blockchain, aims to make an organization, upon its establishment, comply with specific specifications through smart contracts. It adjusts all participants' privileges through a contract mechanism.

- **BaaS**

  BaaS is a decentralized platform built on the existing blockchain technology and protocols, and provides service examples based on public chains.

## Industrial application layer

With the basic protocol layer and the general application layer, blockchain can be used in many specific industries, leading a new round of innovation.

- **Authentication**

  It is mainly used to authenticate the identity, account, address and contract content of users participating in the transaction.

- **Payment**

  As an important part of blockchain finance, it aims to solve the issues of trust, security and anonymity in transactions, realize streaming payment, process funds in real time, and ensure real-time payment by both parties within the agreed time period.

- **NFT**

  The important features of NFTs include: each NFT has one unique identification; NFTs are neither interchangeable nor divisible. More importantly, each NFT represents a value that is different from the other. NFT has set off an upsurge in collectibles and entertainment fields.

- **Fintech**

  The blockchain technology can solve the trust and security issues in transactions, and has thus become an alternative direction for the future upgrade of the financial industry. Through the blockchain, people can trade without any third-party credit intermediaries, reducing the cost of asset transfer on a global scale.

- **Storage**

  Blockchain can guarantee the security of stored files. With the help of blockchain-based decentralized cloud storage, data retention and transmission are more secure. At the same time, since every change in blockchain transactions can be tracked and recorded in distributed and public ledgers, blockchain storage becomes an ideal choice for keeping any form of financial transaction records that require audit management.

- **Data service**

  It mainly provides three services: data sharing, database and data preservation, for example, Oracle chain, Streamr, and The graph.

- **Law**

  The legal application of distributed evidence of blockchain is mainly embodied in three aspects: copyright protection, evidence preservation, and electronic smart contracts.

- **Energy**

  Blockchain is widely used in the energy industry, and provides data for energy service operators, for example, carbon neutrality.

- **DeFI**

  DeFi, or Decentralized Finance, is broadly defined as new forms of financial products, aiming to create a distributed and more competitive financial system in an open, open-source, and barrier-free blockchain ecosystem and realize distributed transactions in the global market. It involves underlying infrastructure, financial infrastructure, and user interaction interface, e.g. Maker, Uniswap, etc.

- **Data application scenarios**

  Map ugc, global battery recycling, global logistics information tracing, etc.

## Adaptation research

We welcome developers to experiment on the PlatON development testnet(Devnet2) based on open-source ecosystem projects. Examples are as below;

- **Private transactions**-Tornado Cash is a private transaction middleware implemented on Ethereum based on zero-knowledge proof (ZKP). It uses zk-SNARK and can *send ETH and ERC20 tokens (DAI, cDAI, USDC, USDT, and WBTC) to any address *in an untraceable manner;*
- **Identity authentication**-The decentralized identity management system can generate a unique identity on the chain for users, allowing unified identity authentication across applications. It can be scaled to multiple authentication and cross-validation;
- **"Stateless"**, light (stateless) nodes can verify all transactions and all parts of the state without materially storing any state. Statelessness allows the various states of/stateless existence of light clients, and each state requires different specifications to make nodes easier to access. One example is the Mina protocol.
